# Ajax

This my own work for [Udacity's Ajax course](). 

The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

* the XHR object
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method
* the Fetch API

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.

## Instructions

You have to use a server in order to run. In the base folder type the following command for python 3

```
python -m http.server
```
